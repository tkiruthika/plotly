## Overview
The overview of this module is to use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web.

## Purpose
We have a dashboard that has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, we should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.

### Deliverable 1
We use JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.

### Delieverable 2
We use JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a bubble chart that will display the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
  - The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
  - The sample_values as the y-axis values.
  - The sample_values as the marker size.
  - The otu_ids as the marker colors.
  - The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

### Delieverable 3
We use JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

### Delieverable 4
With our knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap, customize the webpage for your dashboard.
